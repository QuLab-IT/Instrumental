        <h2><a name="Additional_Safety_Notices"></a><a name="kanchor391"></a>Additional Safety Notices</h2>
        <p>The following general safety precautions must be observed during all phases of operation of this instrument. Failure to comply with these precautions or with specific warnings or instructions elsewhere in this manual violates safety standards of design, manufacture, and intended use of the instrument. Agilent Technologies assumes no liability of the customer’s failure to comply with the requirements.</p>
        <h3>General</h3>
        <p>Do not use this product in any manner not specified by the manufacturer. The protective features of this product may be impaired if it is used in a manner not specified in the operation instructions.</p>
        <h3>Before Applying Power</h3>
        <p>Verify that all safety precautions are taken. Make all connections to the unit before applying power.</p>
        <h3>Ground the Instrument</h3>
        <p>This product is provided with protective earth terminals. To minimize shock hazard, the instrument must be connected to the AC power mains through a grounded power cable, with the ground wire firmly connected to an electrical ground (safety ground) at the power outlet. Any interruption of the protective (grounding) conductor or disconnection of the protective earth terminal will cause a potential shock hazard that could result in personal injury.</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="IndentTight" value="1">Do not operate in an explosive atmosphere.</li>
            <li class="IndentTight" value="2">Do not operate the instrument in the presence of flammable gases or fumes.</li>
            <li class="IndentTight" value="3">Only qualified, service-trained personnel who are aware of the hazards involved should remove instrument covers. Always disconnect the power cable and any external circuits before removing the instrument cover.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Do Not Modify the Instrument</h3>
        <p>Do not install substitute parts or perform any unauthorized modification to the product. Return the product to an Agilent Sales and Service Office for service and repair to ensure that safety features are maintained.</p>
        <h3>In Case of Damage</h3>
        <p>Instruments that appear damaged or defective should be made inoperative and secured against unintended operation until they can be repaired by qualified service personnel.</p>
