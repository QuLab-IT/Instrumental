        <h1><a name="kanchor446"></a>Performance Verification Tests<a name="kanchor447"></a></h1>
        <p>Use the Performance Verification Tests to verify the measurement performance of the instrument. The performance verification tests use the instrument’s specifications listed on the product datasheet.</p>
        <p>You can perform three levels of performance verification tests:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="IndentTight" value="1"><b>Self-Test</b> A series of internal verification tests that give high confidence that the instrument is operational.</li>
            <li class="IndentTight" value="2"><b>Quick Verification</b> A combination of the internal self-tests and selected verification tests.</li>
            <li class="IndentTight" value="3"><b>Performance Verification Tests</b> An extensive set of tests that are recommended as an acceptance test when you first receive the instrument or after performing adjustments.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="SelfTest"></a>Self-Test</h2>
        <p>A brief power-on self-test occurs automatically whenever you turn on the instrument. This limited test assures that the instrument is operational. For details, see <a href="../__H_Block%20Diag%20Svc%20Rep/05%20Self-Test%20Procedures.htm">Self-Test Procedures</a>.</p>
        <h2><a name="Quick_Performance_Check"></a>Quick Performance Check</h2>
        <p>The quick performance check is a combination of internal self-test and an abbreviated performance test (specified by the letter Q in the performance verification tests). This test provides a simple method to achieve high confidence in the instrument's ability to functionally operate and meet specifications. These tests represent the absolute minimum set of performance checks recommended following any service activity. Auditing the instrument’s performance for the quick check points (designated by a Q) verifies performance for normal accuracy drift mechanisms. This test does not check for abnormal component failures.</p>
        <p>To perform the quick performance check, do the following:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="IndentTight" value="1">Perform a <a href="../__H_Block%20Diag%20Svc%20Rep/05%20Self-Test%20Procedures.htm">complete self-test</a>.</li>
            <li class="IndentTight" value="2">Perform only the performance verification tests indicated with the letter Q.</li>
            <li class="IndentTight" value="3">If the instrument fails the quick performance check, adjustment or repair is required.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2><a name="Performance_Verification_Tests"></a>Performance Verification Tests</h2>
        <p>The performance verification tests are recommended as acceptance tests when you first receive the instrument. The acceptance test results should be compared against the specifications on the product datasheet. After acceptance, you should repeat the performance verification tests at every calibration interval.</p>
        <p>If the instrument fails performance verification, adjustment or repair is required.</p>
        <p>Adjustment is recommended at every calibration interval. If adjustment is not made, you must guard band, using no more than 80% of the specifications listed in the datasheet, as the verification limits.</p>
        <h2><a name="Amplitude_and_Flatness_Verifi_Procs"></a>Amplitude and Flatness Verification Procedures</h2>
        <p>The flatness verification procedures use a precision AC voltmeter. You may substitute Thermal Voltage Converters (TVCs) to make measurements using appropriate operating procedures and test equipment.</p>
        <p>Flatness measurements for the -24 dB and -8 dB attenuator ranges are measured during the verification procedure. Other attenuator ranges are verified as a part of -24 dB and -8 dB attenuation range verification procedures. No separate verification procedure is given for these ranges.</p>
