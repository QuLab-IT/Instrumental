        <h1><a name="kanchor470"></a>Calibration Errors</h1>
        <p>The following errors may occur during calibration. There are also <a href="../_Home_Page/SCPI_Error_Messages.htm">system errors</a> and <a href="../__H_Block%20Diag%20Svc%20Rep/05%20Self-Test%20Procedures.htm#Self-TestErrors">self-test errors</a>. Some error messages include a failing channel number (1 or 2), shown as n in the messages below.</p>
        <h3>701	Calibration error; security defeated by hardware jumper</h3>
        <p>If you short the calibration secure jumper (CAL ENABLE) while turning the instrument on, this error indicates the security password has been overwritten. See <a href="03%20Calibration%20Security.htm">Calibration Security</a> for details.</p>
        <h3>702	Calibration error; calibration memory is secured</h3>
        <p>To perform calibration, unsecure the instrument. See <a href="03%20Calibration%20Security.htm">Secure and Unsecure Instrument for Calibration</a> for details.</p>
        <h3>703	Calibration error; secure code provided was invalid</h3>
        <p> Specified security code was invalid.</p>
        <h3>706	Calibration error; value out of range</h3>
        <p>Value entered was  outside valid range.</p>
        <h3>707	Calibration error; signal input is out of range</h3>
        <p>Occurs during the ADC Adjustment, setup 6, if the 1 V input voltage is too high. May also occur during self-calibration (setup 7). Run self-test to diagnose problem.</p>
        <h3>710	Self-calibration failed; Chan n, null DAC cal, invalid self cal<br />Self-calibration failed; Chan n, offset DAC cal with attenuator, invalid self cal<br />Self-calibration failed; Chan n, offset DAC cal no attenuator, invalid self cal</h3>
        <p>Error occurred while performing internal calibration of specified DAC. Self-calibration exited without changing self-calibration constants. Run self-test to diagnose problem.</p>
        <h3>711	Self-calibration failed; Chan n, null DAC cal gain too low (too high), &lt;<i>meas_value</i>&gt;<br />Self-calibration failed; Chan n, offset DAC cal with attenuator gain too low (too high),  &lt;<i>meas_value</i>&gt;<br />Self-calibration failed; Chan n, offset DAC cal no attenuator gain too low (too high),  &lt;<i>meas_value</i>&gt;</h3>
        <p>Computed gain calibration factor for specified DAC was out of limits. Self-calibration exited without changing self-calibration constants. Run self-test to diagnose problem.</p>
        <h3>712	Self-calibration failed; Chan n, null DAC cal zero too low (too high),  &lt;<i>meas_value</i>&gt;<br />Self-calibration failed; Chan n, offset DAC cal with attenuator zero too low (too high),  &lt;<i>meas_value</i>&gt;<br />Self-calibration failed; Chan n, offset DAC cal no attenuator zero too low (too high),  &lt;<i>meas_value</i>&gt;<br />Self-calibration failed; Chan n, GND measurement out of limits,  &lt;<i>meas_value</i>&gt;</h3>
        <p>Computed zero calibration factor for specified DAC was out of limits. Self-calibration exited without changing self-calibration constants. Run self-test to diagnose problem.</p>
        <h3>715	Self-calibration failed; Chan n, null DAC cal, convergence error sub attenuator value dB</h3>
        <p>Internal null DAC calibration failed to converge during internal calibration. Self-calibration exited without changing self-calibration constants. Run self-test to diagnose problem.</p>
        <h3>720	Self-calibration failed; Chan n, offset DAC cal with attenuator, convergence error<br />Self-calibration failed; Chan n, offset DAC cal no attenuator, convergence error</h3>
        <p>Internal offset DAC calibration failed to converge internal calibration. Self-calibration exited without changing self-calibration constants. Run self-test to diagnose problem.</p>
        <h3>850	Calibration error; set up is invalid</h3>
        <p>Invalid calibration setup number selected.</p>
        <h3>850	Calibration error; set up is out of order</h3>
        <p>Certain calibration steps require a specific beginning and ending. Do not enter into middle of a calibration sequence.</p>
